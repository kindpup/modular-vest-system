// ACM Camera Handler Extension
// Fades ACM head-mounted devices with the wearer's own head, so in first person the wearer looks
// THROUGH the optic rather than at the back of it.
//
// MECHANISM: BaseLoadoutClothComponent.SetAlpha, the same call NVsystem uses.
//
// The alphatest value is handed straight to the device's cloth component, which fades the worn model
// through its own material - the same path the character's head is already using. Three properties
// fall out of that and all three matter:
//
//   The value is PASSED THROUGH, not interpreted. Nothing here decides what counts as first person,
//   so nothing here can get the polarity backwards. The device tracks the head, whatever the engine
//   means by any particular number.
//
//   It is a fade, not a visibility flag. EntityFlags.VISIBLE is a switch with no idea when to turn
//   itself back on, which is why the version built on it needed a hidden-entity list, restore-on-
//   body-change, a menu special case and a poll - and why a device could end up permanently
//   invisible, including in the character and inventory previews, which render the real entity.
//
//   Previews are correct for free. Nothing calls OnAlphatestChange in a preview, so the alpha simply
//   stays where it is and the device renders normally.
//
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FINDING THE DEVICES: SCENE CHILDREN ARE NOT ENOUGH.
//
// GetChildren() does not traverse inventory storage, and a helmet-mounted device lives in the
// HELMET'S STORAGE SLOT rather than as a scene child of anything. So a GetChildren() walk from the
// character never reaches it - which is why the previous versions of this file appeared to work on a
// headstrap and did nothing at all on a helmet rail.
//
// This is the third time this project has hit that trap. The remote feed source component resolved
// its carrier as itself and put the camera at the world origin; the visor authority check silently
// refused to grant control; and now this. Worn and slotted gear is in inventory slots, so any search
// for it has to walk storage as well as children - exactly as ACM_RadialMenuItemsComponent already
// does when it builds the device menu.
//
// Loadout areas are still queried directly as well. They are cheap, they are exact, and they cover
// the case of a device worn in its own area rather than mounted on anything.
